Introduction  -
This project analyzes YouTube video data to derive insights and visualize patterns in likes, dislikes, comment counts, and views. The analysis leverages popular data science libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.


Features  -
Data preprocessing and cleaning with pandas
Statistical analysis and manipulation with numpy
Data visualization with seaborn and matplotlib
Machine learning and data splitting with sklearn
Handling imbalanced data with imblearn


Requirements  -
The requirements.txt file contains the following packages:
1.pandas
2.numpy
3.seaborn
4.matplotlib
5.scikit-learn
6.imbalanced-learn


Usage  -
Once the necessary packages are installed, you can start exploring the data and performing analysis. Below are some common operations you might perform.


Data  -
The dataset should include columns such as likes, dislikes, comment_count, and views. Ensure the data is clean and formatted correctly before analysis.


Exploration and Visualization  -
Visualization is a key part of this project. Below are examples of visualizations you can create:
Distribution plots for likes, dislikes, comments, and views
Correlation heatmaps
Pair plots to show relationships between variables
Bar charts for categorical data
